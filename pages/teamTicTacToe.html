    <p>yeaaaah so this probelm is actually pretty simple but my main issue was not using a hashset lol. so def do that</p>
    <P>solution</P>
    <ol>
        <li>find possible victories, first solo by checking if all characters in a row, column or diagonol are the same, then duo if there's only two characters for each of those cases</li>
        <li>if that's true then check if you have already marked that solo win/duo team as a victor. if not, add the winning cows to your list of previously won cows and repeat the process</li>
    </ol>
