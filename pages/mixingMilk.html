    <p>this one is a simuilation i think?? which means that it's pretty simple, just create a program that executes the ideas described</p>
    <p>steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>for 33 iterations, i added the current contents of bucket1 to the current contents of bucket 2 and checked if that was under the max bucket2capacity. if it wasn't, i set the value of bucket 2's contents to that sum and the value of bucket1 to 0. otherwise, i set the value of bucket1's contents to the value of bucket1 + bucket2 - the capacity of bucket 2, as well as set the value of bucket 2's contents to its capacity.</li>
        <li>repeat with next two buckets</li>
        <li>for the last one, i just repeated the process with only bucket1 and bucket 2</li>
    </ol>
