<p>so first of all this probelm isn't that bad!! if ur interested in the way my time ended up getting divided it was like 20 minutes on parsing input,, which i def need to lower, and then an hour on processing that data :3</p>
<p>this probelm is a complete search problem and what it's asking you is, given the gene sequence of spotty cows of normal cows, to find which which genome/s is/are causing spottiness</p>
<p>steps</p>
<ol>
    <li>parse data into two 2d arrays: spotty and normal cows, which are then divided into each genome</li>
    <li>review every column, ie, each genome, in each row, and have a counter for each ACGT character for each type of cow, eg, normalA, normalC, normalG, normalT</li>
    <li>compare the counts of each ACGT character between spotty and normal cows for yo solution</li>
    <li>iterate over that again :3</li>
</ol>
<p>as always, my solution can be found in the usaco folder of this repo!!</p>
