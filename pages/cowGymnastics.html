    <p>ok first of all this probelm was a PAIN IN THE ASS</p>
    <p>second of all!!</p>
    <p>this is a <span class="bold">complete search</span></p>
    <p>anyways i broke this problem into TWO steps!!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>find pairs of cows that are consistent</li>
        <li>remove redundant pairs</li>
    </ol>
    <p>so for the first step i: for cowA, checked every cowB in every row if the position of cowA remained the same relative to cowB, eg greater or less than</p>
    <p>and for step two i converted my cow pair values into a set, which removed redundant pairs for me, and then printed the length of that set</p>
