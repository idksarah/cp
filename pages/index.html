    <p>hi!! i'm one of the many grinding out usaco and leetcode and cses and just whatever programming problems!!</p>
    <p>this is vv simple blog to keep track of the process i went through to get to a solution. the way i break down problems will be applicable to all languages, but all my solutions, which can be found in ./java/cses or ./java/usaco will be in...yk...java</p>
    <p>i basically started grinding these out 12/24 so yes these answers r very janky and probably not the best way to go about solving them,, but i hope this may be helpful!! at least a little. yk</p>

    <p>problems r in no particular order</p>
