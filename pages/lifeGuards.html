    <title>lifeguards solution</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>yeah so my solutio nfor this was rlly bad,, took 2 seconds for the max test cases ajdfjawhfw</p>
    <p>planning to revist this probelm on a later date but for now this is how i did it:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>out of all the times, organize them into sets --each lifeguard's start and end--</li>
        <li>pick one set a, and one setb</li>
        <li>iterate through all possible variations of a and b. each time, create essentially a timeline that calculates the time of every nonfired cow; the way i did this was by iterating through every cow's start and end time and adding that time to a coutner within an array. i then reviewed the array and incremented my max answer for every time there was a nonzero value</li>
    </ol>
