    <p>tbh i'm not sure what type of problem category this fits in, but it was pretty neat.</p>
    <p>steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>create two values, min =45, and max=49. the reason for this is any  value above 45 rounds up according to chain rounding and down according to normal rounding, and any value above 49 rounds up according to both chain rounding and normal rounding. i.e., these are where the values are inconsistent between chain and normal rounding</li>
        <li>for integer a, making sure that it is less than the given power, check if the current value is greater than or equal to 45, then if that value is greater than or equal to 49, in which case increment the count of different values by maximum - minimum + 1. on the other hand, if the current value is greater or equal to the min but less than the maximum, increment the count by current value - minimum + 1</li>
        <li>i then use characteristics of Strings to add on to the initial value for the next step of rounding. eg, 45 is converted into "45" and then has a "4" added to it. i then parse that into an integer and repeat the process</li>
    </ol>
